# Please write a program which asks the user to input a string. 
# The program then prints out different messages if the string contains any of the vowels a, e or o.

# You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. Have a look at the examples below.

# Sample output
# Please type in a string: hello there
# a not found
# e found
# o found

# Sample output
# Please type in a string: hiya
# a found
# e not found
# o not found

if "a" in user_string:
  print ("a found")
else:
  print ("a not found")

if "e" in user_string:
  print ("e found")
else:
  print ("e not found")

if "o" in user_string:
  print ("o found")
