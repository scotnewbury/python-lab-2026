# Part 2 - Simple Loops
#
# Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and prints out the next leap year.
#
# Sample output
# Year: 2023
# The next leap year after 2023 is 2024
#
# If the user inputs a year which is a leap year (such as 2024), the program should print out the following leap year:
#
# Sample output
# Year: 2024
# The next leap year after 2024 is 2028

# The course has been focusing on simple loops and utilizing if/else statements while I could continue this
# trend, I opted to accelerate things and start to include functions. In this case I'll be including a 
#function to check if the year entered is a leap year.
