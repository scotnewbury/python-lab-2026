# Python Lab 2026

After a decade of engineering solutions in the WordPress/PHP ecosystem, I am shifting my primary focus to Python automation and backend architecture.

This repository serves as my central "lab" - a record of my transition, a storage for experiments, and a log of my progress through computer science fundamentals.

## Environment

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Tooling:** venv (virtual environments)

## Lab Contents

### /pythonProgrammingMOOC

Exercises and projects from the **University of Helsinki Python Programming MOOC 2024**.

- **Note:** I often extend these exercises beyond the base requirements to test specific architectural patterns or "what-if" scenarios.

### /codewars

Solutions to algorithmic challenges. My focus here is not just on the "pass," but on writing readable, efficient, and "Pythonic" code.

### /projects (Coming Soon)

Standalone tools, such as a planned terminal-based Google Tasks integration and various backend service prototypes.
